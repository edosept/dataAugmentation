# dataAugmentation
<br>
Augmentation of Image Data -> we change the image with notes without changing the meaning of the data.
<br>

This augmentation slightly changes the original data, with the aim of:
<br>

- to further enrich our data
- increase generality (reduce overfit)

<br>
Some of the transform techniques we use:
<br>

- Random Crop
- Random Flip
- Random Rotation
- Random ResizedCrop
- Random Affine
- Color Jitter

<br><br>
*In the end, this augmentation would enrich machine knowledge to keep learning from the images that we augmented earlier.*
